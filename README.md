# Arnaud Dalcq
## Web developer junior

I'm Arnaud, video game enjoyer, I'm currently studying to become a web developer. During my free time, I like to stream my video games playthrough on Twitch, I like draw from times to times and of course playing video games.

##### My surprising skills : 
- I don't need a lot of sleeping time to be fit for the day
- I have a legendary patience skill, I could wait for long times without getting annoyed
- I'm not so bad at cooking (mainly pastas)

##### My most liked things in this universe :
1. Video games
2. My cat
3. Playing with my friends

##### Becode training
At the end of my Becode training I want to feel able to work in the web industry and to find a job. I'm afraid of not being able to follow the working pace and to feel myself behind my expectations. I'm looking forward to work in teams and to work on original projects.

##### To be a good teammate according to me you should :
- Always be on time
- Reliable
- Respectful
